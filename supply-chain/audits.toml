I have reviewed both bitcoinconsensus and sys-libbitcoinconsensus which it uses to build the relevant bitcoin-core sources.
The bitcoin-core sources are indeed from bitcoin-core v26.
Note that this library does use C bindings and thus FFI and unsafe. There are panic-able code paths if used incorrectly.
This library is provided by the rust-bitcoin GH organization which also maintains the bitcoin and secp256k1 crates which we use extensively.
